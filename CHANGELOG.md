# 0.3.0

- `sendAction` -> regular function calls
- `import Ember from 'ember'` -> `import { computed } from '@ember/object'`
- Upgrade `ember-cli-babel` to avoid deprecation warnings

It's likely that the minimum node version has changed due to this, making this a breaking change. Please upgrade with care.
